# Proximity Sensor Calibration Lab

This ME 303 lab focues on sensor calibration techniques. We setup a calibration apparatus for a capacitive proximity sensor, and recorded sensor voltage data as a function of the distance between the sensor and a steel target. 

Several polynomial fitting techniques were applied to produce a transfer function for the sensor. Outlier detection techniques and confidence intervals were then used. 

This GitHub page typically contains assignments in progress, and as a result, the final report will not be posted electronically until after the assignment due date.
