# Measurement Noise Quantification and Reduction

This ME 303 lab is focused on understanding the sorces of voltage noise in a measurement and implementing common noise reduction techniques. Signal lead length, twisted pairs, differential inputs, and shielding were evaluated quantitatively.

Because this GitHub page contains information regarding an assignment in progress, the final report will not be uploaded until after the assignment due date.
